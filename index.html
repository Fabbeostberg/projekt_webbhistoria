        Yeah
        <br />
        You are my fire
        <br />
        The one desire
        <br />
        Believe when I say
        <br />
        I want it that way
        <br />
        <br />
        But we are two worlds apart
        <br />
        Can't reach to your heart
        <br />
        When you say
        <br />
        That I want it that way
        <br />
        <br />
        Tell me why
        <br />
        Ain't nothin' but a heartache
        <br />
        Tell me why
        <br />
        Ain't nothin' but a mistake
        <br />
        Tell me why
        <br />
        I never want to hear you say
        <br />
        I want it that way
        <br />
        <br />
        Am I, your fire?
        <br />
        Your one, desire Yes I know, it's too late But I want it that way
        <br />
        Tell me why Ain't nothin' but a heartache Tell me why Ain't nothin' but
        a mistake Tell me why, I never want to hear you say I want it that way
        <br />
        <br />
        Now I can see that we've fallen apart From the way that it used to be,
        yeah No matter the distance I want you to know That deep down inside of
        me
        <br />
        You are my fire The one desire You are (you are, you are, you are
        <br />
        <br />
        Tell me why Ain't nothin' but a heartache Tell me why Ain't nothin' but
        a mistake Tell me why I never want to hear you say I want it that way
        <br />
        Tell me why Ain't nothin' but a heartache Ain't nothin' but a mistake
        Tell me why I never want to hear you say (Never want to hear you say it)
        I want it that way
        <br />
        Cause I want it that way
